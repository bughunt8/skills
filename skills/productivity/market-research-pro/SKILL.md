  Production-grade market research: evidence and sizing system model, failure modes (single-source TAM, spurious precision, category mismatch, stale data), decision trade-offs (top-down vs bottom-up, breadth vs depth, speed vs rigor), quality guardrails (no fabricated market sizes; cite source+date+geo).

  Use this skill when the user asks to validate market opportunity, compare competitors, estimate market size with assumptions, identify ICP segments, prioritize country/vertical expansion, or produce an executive-style market brief with citations and explicit confidence levels.

  Use **with** **`web-research-pro`** for official and current external sources, **`business-analysis-pro`** to convert findings into requirements/roadmaps, and **`data-analysis-pro`** when survey or tabular datasets need numeric analysis. This skill (`market-research-pro`) owns **research framing and synthesis quality**; other skills own deep implementation or analytics details.

  Triggers: "market research", "TAM", "SAM", "SOM", "competitive analysis", "market sizing", "ICP segments", "market brief", "market opportunity", "competitor landscape", "market entry", "expansion hypothesis".

# Market research (professional)

Skill text is **English**; answer in the user's preferred language when rules or the conversation specify it.

Use official company sources, regulatory filings, and high-quality industry reports as preferred evidence; this skill encodes **assumption-driven sizing**, **source reliability ranking**, and **decision-ready** synthesis. Confirm **market definition**, **geography**, **time horizon**, and **decision context** (invest, build, expand, price).

## Boundary

**`market-research-pro`** owns **what market signals mean for decisions**, **sizing methods**, **competitive framing**, and **evidence quality**. **`web-research-pro`** owns **how** to gather and verify external sources. **`business-analysis-pro`** owns **requirements and delivery** artifacts from decisions.

## Related skills (this repo)

| Skill | When to combine with `market-research-pro` |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| **`web-research-pro`** | Collect and verify external sources, changelogs, and citation quality |
| **`business-analysis-pro`** | Convert findings into initiative scope, requirements, and priority |
| **`data-analysis-pro`** | Analyze survey/usage/exported datasets numerically |
| **`seo-pro`** | Search-demand and organic visibility angle for web-first products |

## When to use

- Market sizing with transparent assumptions (TAM/SAM/SOM).
- Competitor landscape and differentiated positioning.
- ICP/segment prioritization and expansion hypotheses.
- Pricing and packaging hypothesis framing (not final finance model).
- Trend scan for strategic direction with citation discipline.

## When not to use

- **Legal or investment advice** as binding opinion — surface evidence and defer to counsel/investors.
- **Primary survey design** as the main topic — pair **`data-analysis-pro`** for instrument and stats.

## Required inputs

- **Decision** the research supports (or explicit "exploratory").
- **Market boundary** draft (category, geo, timeframe) when sizing.

## Expected output

Follow **Suggested response format (STRICT)** — eight sections including explicit confidence.

## Workflow

Apply **Karpathy principles** throughout: Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution.

1. **Confirm** decision to support (go/no-go, segment priority, pricing hypothesis), market boundaries, and timeframe. → verify: [context documented].
2. **State assumptions** about requirements, constraints (**Think Before Coding**).
3. **Apply** minimum solution first; escalate only when justified (**Simplicity First**).
4. **Make surgical changes** — only touch code directly related to the request (**Surgical Changes**).
5. **Define success criteria**; loop until verified (**Goal-Driven Execution**).
6. **Respond** using **Suggested response format**; note main risks.

### Operating principles

1. **Think Before Coding** — Confirm the decision, market boundary, geography, and time horizon before sizing or comparing anything. Ask when the category itself is unstable or ambiguous.
2. **Simplicity First** — Use the smallest defensible evidence set and sizing method that answers the decision. Do not fabricate precision or build heavyweight market models without need.
3. **Surgical Changes** — Analyze only the relevant market slice, segment, or competitor frame. Do not expand into broad industry theory unless it changes the decision.
4. **Goal-Driven Execution** — Done = the research supports a decision with explicit assumptions, source dates, and confidence.
5. **Evidence quality is part of the result** — A weak source should weaken the claim, not be hidden behind polished prose.
6. **Sizing is assumption math** — TAM/SAM/SOM outputs are only as good as the boundary and denominator logic behind them.
7. **Competitors are contextual** — Substitute, adjacent, and direct competitors should not be flattened into one category.
8. **Market research is not prophecy** — Uncertainty and outdated or conflicting signals should remain visible.

## Default recommendations by scenario

- **Exploratory market scan** — Start with category definition, key segments, and a small competitor map.
- **Sizing request** — State the method and assumptions before quoting any market number.
- **Expansion decision** — Compare geographies or verticals on the few criteria that drive the actual choice.
- **Positioning question** — Clarify substitute and direct competitor sets before claiming differentiation.

## Decision trees

Summary: choose top-down, bottom-up, competitor-first, or segment-first research paths based on the decision and available evidence.

## Anti-patterns

Summary: single-source TAM, stale benchmark reuse, spurious precision, and competitor sets that do not match buyer reality.

### Market sizing and assumptions (summary)

How to bound TAM/SAM/SOM and keep assumption math visible instead of implied.

Details: [references/market-sizing-and-assumptions.md](references/market-sizing-and-assumptions.md)

### Competitor and positioning (summary)

How to compare categories, substitutes, and direct players without collapsing them into shallow feature grids.

Details: [references/competitor-and-positioning.md](references/competitor-and-positioning.md)

### Segment prioritization and GTM (summary)

How to reason about ICPs, wedges, and go-to-market sequencing from evidence rather than preference.

Details: [references/segment-prioritization-and-gtm.md](references/segment-prioritization-and-gtm.md)

### Reporting and evidence quality (summary)

How to present findings with source/date/geo context and honest confidence levels.

Details: [references/reporting-and-evidence-quality.md](references/reporting-and-evidence-quality.md)

## Suggested response format (STRICT)

1. **Context** — Decision, market boundary, geography, timeframe, and confidence needs.
2. **Research model** — Explain the sizing or competitor frame and why it fits the decision.
3. **Findings** — Evidence-backed market, segment, or competitor conclusions with assumptions visible.
4. **Verification** — Source/date/geo anchors and what would need refreshing later.
5. **Residual risks** — Weak evidence, category ambiguity, or stale-data exposure.

## Quick example

**Input:** "Estimate the market for a developer tool in Southeast Asia."
- Define the category and geography before computing any size estimate.
- Use transparent assumptions instead of quoting a single magic TAM number.
- **Verify:** The output shows the method, source dates, and the assumption chain.

**Input (tricky):** "This competitor report gives contradictory market sizes."
- Compare source scope, year, and category definition before choosing a number.
- Preserve uncertainty instead of reconciling by guesswork.
- **Verify:** The report explains why the figures differ and which one is more decision-usable.

**Input (cross-skill):** "Research the market, then turn it into a product wedge."
- Pair **`web-research-pro`** for source gathering and **`business-analysis-pro`** or **`strategic-consulting-pro`** for decision conversion.
- Keep evidence collection and strategy framing distinct.
- **Verify:** The wedge recommendation is traceable back to segment evidence rather than intuition alone.
