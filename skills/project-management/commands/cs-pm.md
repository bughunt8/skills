description: Top-level project-management router. Classifies a PM inquiry across 8 lanes (sprint/flow, portfolio health, Jira, Confluence, admin, templates, meetings, comms) with a deterministic script and forks context to the right sub-skill via the pm-skills orchestrator, returning a ≤200-word digest with a named owner and one grill challenge.
argument-hint: "<PM inquiry: sprint health, project status, JQL, permissions, retro, comms, etc.>"

# /cs:pm — Project Management router

Route this inquiry through the `pm-skills` orchestrator:

**$ARGUMENTS**

## Routing (deterministic — run the script, don't eyeball)

```bash
python3 skills/project-management/skills/pm-skills/scripts/pm_goal_router.py --repo-root . --text "$ARGUMENTS" --output json
```

- Exit 0 → require `binding_verified: true`, bind the exact `qualified_provider_path`
  and follow that skill in approved scope. Do not pass an ambiguous bare name
  to a loader or assume the host supports forked agents.
- Exit 2 → ask ONE clarifying question naming the listed candidates, recommended answer
  first.
- Exit 3 → ask the user to restate the goal with the deliverable named. Never guess.
- Exit 4 → stop on missing, stale, wrong-identity or user-only provider metadata.
  Never switch providers silently. Pass the inquiry as one argv value, not
  an interpolated shell command. Metadata verification grants no mutation authority.
- Explore the workspace first — a saved Jira snapshot, retro log, or transcript resolves
  the lane silently. Never silently chain a second sub-skill.

## Output (≤200-word digest)

- What was analyzed (with the data source — snapshot file, not memory)
- Top 3 findings, each anchored to a canon citation
- Top 3 next actions with a named human owner
- Artifact path
- One grill challenge (e.g. "Your health report is self-reported RAG — where's the
  derived diff that catches watermelons?")

## Hard rules

- Flow numbers come from `jira_snapshot_bridge.py` on real snapshot data.
- Forecasts are Monte Carlo percentile ranges, never single dates.
- Live Jira/Confluence ops use only the tools in
  `skills/project-management/references/atlassian-mcp-tools.md` — never invent tool names.
- Goals (not questions) go to `/cs:pm-loop` instead.

## Retrospective namespace

Use `/cs:pm sprint retrospective action items` for a team or sprint
retrospective. Its qualified target is
`skills/project-management/skills/scrum-master/SKILL.md`.
Matt's `/retro` reviews an agent coding environment and is a different,
human-only skill. Do not alias PM retrospectives to it. The historical PM
guide's `/retro` label has no matching installed PM command definition.

## Distinct from

- `product-team` — what to build. This domain is how to deliver it.
- `/cs:harness` — the generic loop engine; `/cs:pm-loop` is its PM-domain adapter.
